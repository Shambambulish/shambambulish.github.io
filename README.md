##Pros and cons of watching The Office[^1]
Pros
- Michael Scott
- Funny
Cons
- You will not have any more of it to watch once you are done

[^1]: I am not sponsored by BBC or the show and have – in fact – never seen an episode of it. I cannot confirm whether or not it is worth your time, I just thought this would be a funny thing to write.
